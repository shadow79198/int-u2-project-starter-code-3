    <h1>What can be done to have more gun safety in Indiana?</h1>
    <h2>There are some steps that citizens can do to control the gun ownership</h2>

    <div class="dropout-menu">
      <div class="text-final">
        <h2>Universal background checks</h2>
        <p>During private purchases of a gun it is not requiered to conduct a background check,
          this can cause for someone who shouldn't have a gun get access to it. This is why developing a way to have a background check on every invididual, regardless if its a public or private purchase, would increase to lower the number of gun-violence happening in the country</p>
        <h2>Developing more licenses to own a gun</h2>
        <p>In Indiana there is no need to show a license to own a gun, which makes it dangerous for everyone, Indiana also doesn't ask for an ID when buying a gun. So the development of licenses and related certificates would improve
          safety for everyone since those certificates would stop anyone in owning a gun that they would otherwise
        </p>
        <h2>Close the Charleston Loophole</h2>
        <p>The Brady Act, also known as Charleston Loophole because of the Charleston church shooting, allows for gun shops to sell any person a gun if the background check takes longer than 3 business days. This is a highly dangerous practice because most of the time those background checks that takes
          longer than 3 days are usually rejected, but because of the practice happenig it allows those people to own a gun. The Charleston Loophole has been a controvertial act that some states have regulated agaisnt it. 22 of the 52 states have made some sort of regulation of this act, and only 4 states have
          fully banned the practice. However this practice should change, because if it doesn't then it would allow many people to own a gun when they shouldn't otherwise
